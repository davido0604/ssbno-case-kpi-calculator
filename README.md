## Case Study
The users of ssb.no wants an application that allows them to calculate how much the value of the currency (NOK) has changed over time. The basis for the computations are the monthly consumer price indices from Statistics Norway. [`Here are some examples of calculations.`](https://www.ssb.no/priser-og-prisindekser/regneeksempler#Utregning_av_prosentvis_endring) These are the acceptance criterias that must be fullfilled:

* Users must be able to input an amount/price
* Users must be able to pick a year and choose a month or yearly average for the date range
* All fields must be filled
* Users must be presented with the results of the computation after pressing a button
* The results must include the new amount/price of the currency and the increase in percentage

We will be prepping a few things for you by using NextJs, you may refactor and make as many adjustments as you'd like.

**Optional tasks:**
* Form validation
* Tests
* Visualization
* Universal design
* Authentication

### Resources
There are two versions of the inflation calculator, where the calculator at the front page is a simpler version:

You may use the components from our design system, or use your own styling for the calculator:

## Getting Started
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
